        As an Oakland-native born during the tech boom in Silicon Valley,
        Vanessa has always been interested in technology and has been working on
        computers for as long as she can remember. She learned that through
        code, she could create whatever she dreamt of. Even more, she loves how
        self-reliant coding makes you. Whether your code works or not, is up to
        you. Vanessa, seeing the similarities between coding and art, decided to
        pursue and master both.
